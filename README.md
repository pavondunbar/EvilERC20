# Malicious ERC20 Token - Security Research & Testing Contract

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This repository contains deliberately vulnerable and malicious smart contract code designed exclusively for security research, education, and testing purposes. **DO NOT DEPLOY THIS CONTRACT ON ANY PRODUCTION NETWORK.**

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains a malicious ERC20 token implementation that incorporates multiple attack vectors and deceptive behaviors. It is intended to:

1. Help security researchers understand token-based threats
2. Provide security auditors with a comprehensive reference for token vulnerabilities
3. Enable security testing in controlled environments
4. Educate developers on how to identify and mitigate token-based attacks
5. Demonstrate real-world scam tactics used by malicious actors

## Attack Vectors & Vulnerabilities

This contract intentionally implements numerous security vulnerabilities and malicious features:

### Token Ownership & Control Exploits
- Hidden admin functionality with privileged operations
- Backdoor access through secret keys
- Ability to upgrade/migrate tokens (rugpull vector)
- Hidden operator roles with elevated permissions

### Token Balance Manipulation
- Direct token theft from user wallets
- Ability to blacklist any address
- Shadow balances that misrepresent actual token ownership
- Balance inflation for contract interactions (oracle manipulation)

### Trading Restrictions & Honeypot Mechanisms
- Explicit honeypot mode to prevent selling
- Stealth honeypot that activates after X transactions
- Anti-bot measures that can be weaponized
- Maximum transaction/wallet limits

### Fee Structure Manipulation
- Asymmetric fees for buys, sells, and transfers
- Ability to change fees after launch
- Fee diversion to hidden wallets

### Technical Attack Vectors
- Reentrancy exploits targeting DEXes and other contracts
- Fake minting that emits events but doesn't create tokens
- Self-destruct functionality with fund extraction
- Callback attacks during token operations

### Privacy & User Targeting
- Tracking system for all wallet interactions
- Ability to target specific users for later exploitation
- Mass operations against collected addresses

## Benefits for Security Researchers & Auditors

By studying this contract, security professionals can:

1. **Comprehensive Reference**: Access a single contract containing most known token attack vectors in one place
2. **Training Resource**: Train new security auditors on identifying various malicious patterns
3. **Testing Environment**: Test security tools and methodologies against known vulnerabilities
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn to recognize the signature patterns of malicious code
5. **Defense Development**: Develop and test defensive solutions against these attack vectors
6. **Client Education**: Demonstrate to clients what malicious code looks like
7. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare against real-world tokens to identify suspicious behaviors

## Responsible Usage Guidelines

This code is shared with the expectation of responsible usage:

- **Controlled Testing**: Only deploy on local test networks, private networks, or specialized security testing environments
- **Educational Use**: Use for educational purposes with proper context and warnings
- **Defensive Research**: Focus on developing countermeasures and detection tools
- **Disclosure**: When discussing findings based on this code, always provide proper context about its intentionally malicious nature

## Real-World Context

Unfortunately, malicious tokens are actively deployed on various blockchain networks. Understanding these attack vectors is crucial for:

- DApp developers integrating with unknown tokens
- DEX operators vetting token listings
- Wallet developers implementing safety features
- End users making informed decisions

## Technical Documentation

The contract implements a standard ERC20 interface but contains numerous malicious modifications:

- **Token Creation**: Appears to be a standard token but contains hidden supply and admin functionality
- **Transfer Logic**: Modified to include fees, restrictions, and potential blocking
- **Balance Reporting**: Manipulated to show incorrect values in certain contexts
- **Permissions System**: Complex set of roles and capabilities that enable exploits
- **External Interactions**: Dangerous patterns when interacting with other contracts
