# Malicious ERC20 Token - Comprehensive Security Research & Testing Contract

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING: EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY** ‚ö†Ô∏è

This repository contains deliberately vulnerable and malicious smart contract code designed exclusively for security research, education, and testing purposes. **DO NOT DEPLOY THIS CONTRACT ON ANY PRODUCTION NETWORK.**

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository contains a malicious ERC20 token implementation that incorporates multiple attack vectors and deceptive behaviors. It is intended to:

1. Help security researchers understand token-based threats
2. Provide security auditors with a comprehensive reference for token vulnerabilities
3. Enable security testing in controlled environments
4. Educate developers on how to identify and mitigate token-based attacks
5. Demonstrate real-world scam tactics used by malicious actors

## Attack Vectors & Vulnerabilities (40+ Attack Vectors)

This contract intentionally implements numerous security vulnerabilities and malicious features:

### Token Ownership & Control Exploits
- Hidden admin functionality with privileged operations
- Backdoor access through secret keys
- Ability to upgrade/migrate tokens (rugpull vector)
- Hidden operator roles with elevated permissions
- **NEW**: Time-delayed admin takeover mechanism
- **NEW**: Delegated attacker role to obscure attack chain

### Token Balance Manipulation
- Direct token theft from user wallets
- Ability to blacklist any address
- Shadow balances that misrepresent actual token ownership
- Balance inflation for contract interactions (oracle manipulation)
- **NEW**: Fake approvals that appear valid but don't function
- **NEW**: Supply manipulation showing different totals to different callers

### Trading Restrictions & Honeypot Mechanisms
- Explicit honeypot mode to prevent selling
- Stealth honeypot that activates after X transactions
- Anti-bot measures that can be weaponized
- Maximum transaction/wallet limits
- **NEW**: Time-based transaction blocking

### Fee Structure Manipulation
- Asymmetric fees for buys, sells, and transfers
- Ability to change fees after launch
- Fee diversion to hidden wallets
- **NEW**: Dynamic fee scaling based on block timestamps

### Technical Attack Vectors
- Reentrancy exploits targeting DEXes and other contracts
- Fake minting that emits events but doesn't create tokens
- Self-destruct functionality with fund extraction
- Callback attacks during token operations
- **NEW**: Gas griefing attack to increase transaction costs
- **NEW**: ERC20 standard violations applied selectively
- **NEW**: Flash loan-style exploitation capability
- **NEW**: Malicious fallback function that blacklists callers

### Privacy & User Targeting
- Tracking system for all wallet interactions
- Ability to target specific users for later exploitation
- Mass operations against collected addresses
- **NEW**: Front-running attack vectors
- **NEW**: Signature-based backdoor access

### Blockchain & Transaction Manipulation
- **NEW**: Transfer event manipulation to confuse blockchain explorers 
- **NEW**: Fake burn function that appears to work but doesn't
- **NEW**: Permit function with inconsistent signature validation
- **NEW**: Block timestamp manipulation for targeted attacks

## Using This Contract for Testing

### Setting Up Test Environments

1. **Local Testing**: 
   - Deploy only on local development networks like Hardhat, Ganache, or Foundry's Anvil
   - Never deploy to testnets where other users may interact with it

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Use this token to test DEXes, wallets, and other DApps against attack vectors
   - Create mocks for each attack type to isolate specific vulnerabilities

### Configuration Options

The contract provides extensive configuration to enable/disable specific attack vectors:

```solidity
// Basic configuration
toggleProtection(bool honeypot, bool stealthHoneypot, bool reentrancyExploit);
configureTradingParameters(bool enableTrading, uint256 maxTx, uint256 maxWallet, uint256 cooldown);
setFees(uint256 buy, uint256 sell, uint256 transferFeeAmount);

// Advanced attack configuration
configureAttackVectors(
    bool enableGasGriefing,
    bool enableTimestampManipulation,
    bool enableSupplyManipulation,
    bool enableFakeApprovals,
    bool enableERC20Violations
);
```

### Security Testing Procedure

1. **Initial Testing**:
   - Deploy token with all attack vectors disabled
   - Establish baseline functionality
   - Enable specific attack vectors one by one

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Connect token to DEX liquidity pools
   - Test buying/selling behavior
   - Test sandwich attack potential 
   - Verify price impact calculations

3. **Protocol Defense Testing**:
   - Test protocol's token validation measures
   - Verify blacklist detection
   - Test fee manipulation detection

## Testing Specific Attack Scenarios

### Honeypot Testing
```solidity
// Enable stealth honeypot that activates after 50 transactions
token.toggleProtection(true, true, false);
token.honeypotActivationThreshold = 50;
```

### Balance Manipulation Testing
```solidity
// Test if your contract properly handles balance manipulation
// Your contract should query balances directly rather than trusting reports
uint256 reportedBalance = token.balanceOf(address);
// Verify if your contract can detect the discrepancy
```

### Gas Griefing Defense
```solidity
// Enable gas griefing attack
token.configureAttackVectors(true, false, false, false, false);
// Set transaction threshold
token._gasGriefingThreshold = 10;
// Test if your contract implements proper gas limits
```

### Flash Loan Attack Testing
```solidity
// Try to use the flash action to exploit your protocol
token.flashAction(yourContract, attackData);
// Verify if your protocol can withstand temporary balance inflation
```

## Best Practices for Defensive Development

Based on these attack vectors, implement these defenses:

1. **Token Vetting**:
   - Verify token source code for malicious patterns
   - Check contract ownership structure
   - Verify that fee structures are reasonable and fixed
   - Confirm standard ERC20 compliance

2. **Interaction Safety**:
   - Never trust token balance reports; verify with transfers
   - Implement reentrancy guards on all entry points
   - Set reasonable gas limits for token operations
   - Verify transfer success with before/after balance checks

3. **Trading Protection**:
   - Implement price impact limits
   - Add slippage protection
   - Verify transactions can be reversed
   - Test selling tokens before large purchases

## Benefits for Security Researchers & Auditors

1. **Comprehensive Reference**: Access a single contract containing 40+ known token attack vectors in one place
2. **Training Resource**: Train new security auditors on identifying various malicious patterns
3. **Testing Environment**: Test security tools and methodologies against known vulnerabilities
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Learn to recognize the signature patterns of malicious code
5. **Defense Development**: Develop and test defensive solutions against these attack vectors
6. **Client Education**: Demonstrate to clients what malicious code looks like
7. **Comparative Analysis**: Compare against real-world tokens to identify suspicious behaviors

## Responsible Usage Guidelines
